# DSA Progress - Day 2

## Problems Solved

1. **Majority Element (n/3 times)**

   - Learned how to extend Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm for cases where elements appear more than ⌊n/3⌋ times.
   - Practiced edge cases where multiple candidates can exist.

2. **3-Sum Problem**

   - Applied **two-pointer technique** after sorting.
   - Learned how to avoid duplicates efficiently.
   - Improved understanding of time complexity optimization from O(n³) to O(n²).

3. **4-Sum Problem**
   - Built on the **3-Sum** approach with an extra loop.
   - Learned how to handle multiple nested pointers with pruning techniques.
   - Explored using hash sets vs. sorting + two-pointer.
