## 📝 Key Formulas

### Simple Interest (SI)

\[
SI = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
\]
Where:

- **P** = Principal
- **R** = Rate of Interest (% per annum)
- **T** = Time (in years)

- Total Amount (A) = P + SI

---

### Compound Interest (CI)

\[
A = P \times \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^T
\]  
\[
CI = A - P
\]

Where:

- **A** = Final Amount
- **P** = Principal
- **R** = Rate of Interest (% per annum)
- **T** = Time (in years)

## ✅ Practice Summary

- **Simple Interest:** 10–15 questions solved
- **Compound Interest:** 5 questions solved

### 📌 Notes

- SI grows linearly with time, CI grows exponentially.
- Difference between SI and CI increases as time period increases.
- For small time periods or low rates, SI ≈ CI.
