# Data Tech Stack - Python Revision (Day 2)

## Topics Revised

- **Tuples**

  - Properties: Immutable, ordered, allows duplicates
  - Common functions: `count()`, `index()`
  - Usage in fixed data collections

- **Dictionaries**

  - Key-Value pairs
  - Functions & methods: `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`, `get()`, `update()`, `pop()`
  - Practical use in storing structured data

- **Sets**

  - Properties: Unordered, unique elements
  - Functions: `add()`, `remove()`, `union()`, `intersection()`, `difference()`
  - Real-life use: removing duplicates

- **Frozen Sets**
  - Immutable version of sets
  - Useful in hashable data structures (like dictionary keys)

---

## Practiced Programs

- Tuple indexing and slicing
- Dictionary CRUD operations
- Set operations (union, intersection, difference)
- Frozen set demonstration with immutability
- Small practice programs using these data structures

---

## Key Learnings

- Difference between **mutable (dict, set)** and **immutable (tuple, frozenset)** objects.
- Importance of sets and frozen sets in ensuring **uniqueness** and **hashability**.
- Improved confidence in using Python’s built-in data structures for problem-solving.

✅ **Focus Today**: Hands-on revision of **Python core data structures**
