# Day 8 - Project Revision

**Capstone Project: Real Estate Data Science**

---

## Project Overview

- Focused on **real estate insights, predictions, and recommendations** using end-to-end data science.
- Workflow includes data collection, cleaning, feature engineering, EDA, model building, deployment.

---

## Workflow Details

- **Data Gathering**: Self-scraped from 99acres + similar datasets.
- **Data Cleaning & Merging**: Removed missing values, merged flat & house data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Added new variables (extra rooms, age, furnishing, luxury score).
- **EDA**: Univariate & multivariate analysis (Pandas Profiling).
- **Outlier Handling**: Removed extreme cases, imputed missing values.
- **Feature Selection**: Correlation analysis, LASSO, RFE, SHAP, feature importance from ML models.

---

## Model Selection

Compared multiple regressors:

- Linear Regression, Ridge, LASSO, ElasticNet
- SVR, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN
- MLP (Neural Network)

**Outcome**: Best-performing model integrated into a prediction pipeline.

---

## Analytics Module

- Visualizations: Maps, Word Clouds, Scatter Plots, Pie Charts, Box Plots.
- Helped users explore market trends interactively.

---

## Recommender System

- Recommendations based on:
  - Top facilities
  - Price insights
  - Location advantages
- Built with Streamlit for user interactivity.

---

## Deployment

- Application deployed on **AWS** for accessibility and scalability.
- Modules included prediction, analytics, and recommendations.

---

## Project Impact

- Demonstrated **end-to-end data science pipeline**.
- Practical real-world deployment with **Streamlit + AWS**.
- Strengthened skills in **EDA, ML modeling, feature engineering, recommender systems, and deployment**.
