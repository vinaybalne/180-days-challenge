Indexes (LangChain Short Notes)
Indexes store and organize documents for fast search and retrieval.

Used mainly with vector stores (databases that store document embeddings).

Help avoid duplicated, outdated, or unchanged content, saving time and money.

Make it easy for AI to find and use the most relevant information from lots of data.

Main components: loader (gets data), splitter (breaks into chunks), vector store, retriever.

In short: Indexes = AIâ€™s organized storage for quick search and smart answers
