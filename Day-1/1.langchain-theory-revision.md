# GenAI & AgenticAI — Revision Notes (07-09-2025)

## 🚀 Fundamentals

1. **What is GenAI?**  
   👉 Capability of AI models to generate human like content (e.g., text, image, audio, video).

2. **What is AgenticAI?**  
   👉 AI which can take up a task, plan the entire process, and execute it by performing actions itself through tool integrations.

3. **Differences between GenAI and AgenticAI**

   - GenAI → Reactive, cannot perform actions, memory problem, cannot plan tasks.
   - AgenticAI → Proactive, plans the process and execution, takes actions.
     > Note: GenAI and building AI Agents are subsets within AgenticAI.

4. **Differences between GenAI and Traditional AI (ML, NLP, DL)**
   - GenAI: Learns distribution of data → generates new, human-like content.
   - Traditional AI: Learns input/output relation → predicts/inferences on new data.

## 💡 Scenario Example

**Hiring a candidate (Data Analytics, 2–3 yrs experience):**

- With GenAI: Generate job description, candidate summaries.
- With AgenticAI: Understand requirements, plan steps, execute actions (screening, scheduling, evaluations).

## 🏗️ Concepts

7. **Foundational Models**  
   👉 Trained on internet-scale data, requiring massive GPUs, high costs, labeled data, processing, and fine-tuning. Examples: LLMs, LMMs.

8. **Learning Path**
   1. Building foundational models.
   2. Using foundational models for LLM-based apps from a user’s perspective.

## 🔧 LangChain Basics

9. **What is LangChain?**  
   👉 Open-source platform to build LLM-based complex applications.

10. **Features of LangChain**

- Supports all major LLMs with similar code.
- Chains simplify flows.
- Wide integration with tools.
- Open source, actively developed.

11. **Benefits of LangChain**

- Concept of chains.
- Model-agnostic development.
- Complete ecosystem of components.
- Memory & state handling.

12. **What can we build?**

- Conversational chatbots
- AI agents
- Workflow automation
- Summarisation

13. **Alternatives**  
    👉 LlamaIndex, Haystack.

14. **LangChain Components**  
    👉 Models, Prompts, Chains, Memory, Indexes, Agents.
