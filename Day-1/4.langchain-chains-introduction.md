# LangChain Chains

## ðŸ“Œ Definition
Chains = **Step-by-step workflow**  

They are like connecting blocks in a line:  
- Each block does something (fetch data, ask a question, summarize, translate, etc.).  
- The **output of one step** becomes the **input of the next**.  

ðŸ‘‰ Example: Get info â†’ Summarize â†’ Translate â†’ Return result.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
- Automates **multi-step tasks**.  
- Saves time: no need to write logic manually for each step.  
- You arrange steps â†’ LangChain executes them in order.

## ðŸ”Ž Types of Chains
1. **Simple Chain** â†’ One step (e.g., ask a question).  
2. **Multi-step Chain** â†’ Two or more steps (e.g., summarize + translate).  
3. **Conditional Chain** â†’ Branches based on results (if *yes* â†’ do A, else â†’ do B).  
4. **Parallel Chain** â†’ Runs steps at the same time, then combines results.

## âš¡ How Chains Work
- Connect basic components: **Prompt â†’ Model â†’ Output Parser â†’ Retriever**.  
- Each component:  
  - Takes input  
  - Processes it  
  - Passes result forward  



ðŸ‘‰ Can also use **pipe syntax**:  
```python
chain = prompt | model | parser
