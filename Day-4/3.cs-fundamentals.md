# CS Fundamentals - Day 4

## Topic: Operating Systems Revision

### 1. Introduction

- Operating System (OS) is system software that manages hardware, software resources, and provides services to applications.
- Acts as an **interface between user and hardware**.

---

### 2. Types of Operating Systems

- **Batch OS** – Executes jobs in batches without user interaction.
- **Time-Sharing OS** – Allows multiple users to share system resources simultaneously.
- **Distributed OS** – Manages multiple computers as a single system.
- **Real-Time OS (RTOS)** – Provides immediate response; used in critical systems.
- **Network OS** – Provides networking features and resource sharing.

---

### 3. Process Management

- **Process**: A program in execution.
- **States of Process**:
  - New → Ready → Running → Waiting → Terminated
- **Threads**: Lightweight processes that share resources but execute independently.

---

### 4. Scheduling

- **Scheduling Algorithms**:
  - **FCFS** (First Come First Serve) – Simple queue-based.
  - **SJF** (Shortest Job First) – Minimizes waiting time.
  - **Round Robin** – Time-slice scheduling, fair for all.
  - **Priority Scheduling** – Based on process priority.
  - **Multilevel Queue Scheduling** – Divides processes into queues.

---

## Key Learnings

- Understood **types of OS** and their applications.
- Revised **process lifecycle and states**.
- Learned how **scheduling algorithms** affect CPU utilization and response time.

✅ **Status**: Revision of Operating Systems fundamentals completed.
