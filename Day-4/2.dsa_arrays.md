# DSA Practice - Day 4

## Problems Solved

1. **Merge Intervals**

   - Learned how to sort intervals and merge overlapping ranges.
   - Concepts: Sorting, Greedy approach, Interval handling.

2. **Repeating and Missing Number**

   - Solved using mathematical formulas (sum, sum of squares) and XOR method.
   - Concepts: Arrays, Math tricks, Bit manipulation (XOR).

3. **Count Inversions in an Array**
   - Implemented using Modified Merge Sort (Divide & Conquer).
   - Concepts: Arrays, Merge Sort, Divide & Conquer, Inversion counting.

## Key Learnings

- Importance of **sorting + greedy** in interval-based problems.
- Applied **mathematical equations** and **XOR logic** to optimize array problems.
- Understood how **merge sort** can be extended to solve inversion count efficiently in `O(n log n)`.
