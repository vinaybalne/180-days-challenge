# Aptitude Practice - Day 4

## Topic Covered

- **Time and Work**

---

## Key Concepts

- Work formula:

  - If a person can do a work in **n days**, then in **1 day** they do `1/n` of the work.
  - If A does a work in **x days** and B does in **y days**, then together they finish in `1/x + 1/y` work per day.
  - If A is x times as efficient as B, then ratio of their work = `x : 1`.

- Relations between **Work, Wages, and Efficiency**.
- Concept of **LCM method** to simplify problems.
- Inverse relation between **time and efficiency**.
